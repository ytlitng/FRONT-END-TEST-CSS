Prior to interviewing for any technical position with Tagrem, we ask all candidates to complete a practical test.  The test is purely intended to ensure that candidates have the requisite skills to add value to the organization from their first day on the job.


Before you begin:
-----------------

1. Look at materials\final folder for the final result that we expect you to deliver.

* Note that there are responsive versions beside desktop version

2. The index.html file has all the HTML content already prepared for you to save your typing time.

*You can start with the index.html file, and change the anything you want.

3. Look at materials\specs for documents about the page interaction and color, font-size, etc.

4. You can use any javascript/css framework/library you want.  Feel free to use a CDN for dependencies.

5. Please send your test as a zip file


What is included in the Materials Folders:
--------------------

* Materials- Final Folder: Screenshots of what the final page should look like. This is what we expect your test to look like when you finish.

* Materials- Images Folder: Contains all the images you need to include in your final page.

* Materials- Specs Folder: Use these as a guideline but use your own judgement on what looks most like the provided mocks in the Final folder.


Things we are looking for
--------------------

1. HTML/CSS desktop version that look like the mocks provided in the Final folder.  This should be responsive and degrade gracefully down to mobile

2. Javascript to support all interactive features such as: modals, price filters and product detail selection (details in the specs/screen_mocks.pdf)
